The Be-Secure projects are focused on enabling open-source communities to enhance security for their open-source projects and help build a security community around open-source. There is a growing trend of open-source adoption today and this growth is driving creation of lot more open-source components.

#### [Getting started & Be-Secure Community Dashboard](./Community_dashboard.md) 

 We have a Be-Secure Community Dashboard which can be used to identify the security stature of various open source projects we track. This is a good option to identify the security of your project. In case if your project is not available in the dashboard, please do let us know. We plan to grow the list of open source projects we track and report their security posture using our community dashboard.

 You can map your projects to the Be-Secure open source security tech stack. Once you have identified the Be-Secure open source tech stack, you can then identify the BeSman environments for your project. BeSman environments comprise of dev and security testing environments for each identified open source security tech stack. These environments can be customized per project needs to help you to utilize these environments in a seamless manner to secure your projects.
