    <p>We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting a bug</li>
<li>Discussing the current state of the code</li>
<li>Proposing new features</li>
<li>Becoming a maintainer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="we-develop-with-github">We Develop with Github</h3>
<p>We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.<br />
We Use <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">Github Flow</a>, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">Github Flow</a>). We actively welcome your pull requests:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">Fork the repo</a> and create your branch from <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
<li>Ensure the test suite passes.</li>
<li>Make sure your code lints.</li>
<li>Issue that pull request!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="report-bugs-using-githubs-issues">Report bugs using Github's <a href="https://github.com/Be-Secure/Be-Secure/issues">issues</a></h3>
<p>We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by <a href="https://github.com/Be-Secure/Be-Secure/issues">opening a new issue</a>; it's that easy!</p>
<p><strong>Great Bug Reports</strong> tend to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quick summary and/or background</li>
<li>Steps to reproduce</li>
<li>Be specific!</li>
<li>Give sample code snapshots if you can. </li>
<li>What you expected would happen</li>
<li>What actually happens</li>
<li>Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)</li>
</ul>
<p>People <em>love</em> thorough bug reports. </p>

<p>Please refer to the following <a href="https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman">link</a> to know more about BeSman. It is built using bash and can be easily customized to provision new environments for an <a href="./techstack_details.md">open source tech stack</a> based on open source project requirements. Anyone can leverage BeSman utility to build customized environments for their projects.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set up BeSman utility by following the steps mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman/blob/master/README.md">Readme file.</a>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can <a href="../raise_issue/">raise an issue</a> once you encounter any issue with using available Besman environment scripts or using BeSman utility, we will be glad to help address the issue for you.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in resolving identified issues with the known list of BeSman environments or BeSman utility, you can <a href="../raise_pull_request/">raise a pull request</a> with the required fixes. We value your contributions.</p>
