There are many open source technologies today providing a variety of options for developers to choose for their project needs. Each technology will have certain vulnerabilities inherent in them. Mostly, This aspect is not factored in during selecting an open source technology for the project hence considerable effort is spent on addressing these inherent vulnerabilities during development or later phase.  To address this problem, we have devised Be-Secure open source security stack.

Be-Secure open source security stack is a classification of technologies for enabling open-source developers to identify & leverage suitable BeSman environments that have been security tested by the Be-Secure open-source community.

The different open-source security tech stacks identified based on their characteristics and type of usage are â€“

* Security for DevOps Tools

	
* Language and framework security
	
	
* Applications security
	
	
* Distributed application & blockchain security
	
	
* open source security tool 
	
 
All source code for Be-Secure projects are in GitHub under [Be-Secure](https://github.com/Be-Secure)
